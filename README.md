# stable diffusion prompts - full guide

"Prompt engineering" is the process of creating effective prompts that enable AI models to generate responses based on given inputs . Prompt engineering involves structuring words in a way that can be interpreted and understood by the model. Itâ€™s like speaking a language that the model can understand, so it knows what to draw.

Good prompts are essential for achieving high-quality results. They can help stretch the limitations of Text2IM models and make images go from good to great.

This guide can help you learn how to use Stable Diffusion to create images.
